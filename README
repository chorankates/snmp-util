snmp-util -- a collection of utilities to interact with and manage devices via SNMP

files:
- snmp-map.xml: XML map containing OIDs and a human friendly name, some generic RAM/CPU OIDs as well as some specific to DD-WRT v23

- snmp-monitor.pl: first snmp-util to be written, based on rules (OIDs, Hosts and expected/unexpected results) will send alerts (sms, email, xmpp)
- snmp-monitor_default.rules.xml

todo:
- finish first real draft of snmp-map.xml
- better flesh out snmp-monitor_default.rules.xml with fake data
- implement a pure Net::SNMP mechanism in send_q()
- testing.. for all the code written, it has not been executed 
- write sms send functionality
- write email send functionaltiy
- write xmpp send functionality
